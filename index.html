        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Jaron and I'm a fledgling Software Developer looking for an opportunity to get my career started. I'm still in the process of completing this portfolio site. I work on it occassionly as a side project, but it should have most of what I'd like to display. I'm making this simple site from scratch and plan on using it to direct family, friends and, of course, potential employers somewhere to demonstrate some of the skills that I have acquired while studying Full Stack Web Development at <a href="https://launchschool.com/" target="_blank">LaunchSchool</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in Software Development started in 2014. At this point in my life I didn't really have a "Career Path". I had simply been working hard to get to the best position I could within the company I was working for. That changed when I stumbled across a website called <a href="https://www.codeavengers.com/" target="_blank">CodeAvengers</a>. I started out on their free trials just out of curiosity and was instantly hooked! After I completed the free portion of their program, I jumped right in and paid to have access to their full courses and thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the company I was working for at the time (ExtremeBeam) started going into turbulance and my focus fell back into work.
        </p>
        <p>
          About two years later, I was now working as a Purchasing Manager for a Psychiatric Hospital. I had been in this position for about a year and everything was going smooth. I started re-thinking Software Development, but this time much more seriously. After some long planning, praying and waiting, an opportunity opened up for my wife and I to move in with family, which would allow me to focus my efforts on full-time learning. My wife and I had looked at around a dozen different online programs before deciding on <a href="https://launchschool.com/" target="_blank">LaunchSchool</a>. We chose them because of their Mastery-Based learning model. We didn't want to have some whirlwind educational experience. I wanted to know what I was doing when I was done with whichever program we decided on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another two years later and I have finished their Core Curriculum and am now working on their Advanced Elective courses learning to work with different libraries and frameworks. I am very glad that we chose <a href="https://launchschool.com/" target="_blank">LaunchSchool</a>. I feel very confident with the knowledge and skills that I have gained working through their program.
        </p>

        <p>This is just a few projects that were done as assignments during my time at <a href="https://launchschool.com/" target="_blank">LaunchSchool</a>. Although I built many more projects than this throughout their curriculum, I have only included the ones where no solution was provided.
